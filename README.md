## 📊 Overview

Swish introduces a gesture-centered approach to window management, allowing users to control their workspace with fluid trackpad movements. Instead of relying on manual dragging and resizing, Swish streamlines window organization through a collection of refined gestures that feel fast, natural, and highly efficient.

With its clean interface and smooth animations, the app enhances everyday productivity by turning complex window actions into simple motions. Whether rearranging multiple apps, snapping windows into structured layouts, or quickly maximizing a view, Swish helps maintain an organized desktop with minimal effort.

Its gesture system is precision-tuned for macOS, enabling users to build workflows that prioritize speed and comfort. Swish is ideal for anyone who frequently multitasks and wants a more intuitive way to control application windows.
